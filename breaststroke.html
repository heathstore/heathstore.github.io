<div id="breasttext"><strong>Breaststroke</strong> consists of a frog kick, and a backwards-frog kick pull.  
In this stroke, the kick is more important than the pull. Breaststroke is 80% kick and 20% pull.

Unlike other strokes, not one type of breaststroke is the fastest.

Some people might have a different rhythm then others, and it could be as fast as some one who has little rhythm, but an excellent kick.
  Another unique thing about it is that you breath every stroke.
  Many swimmers believe that breaststroke is the most technically difficultly strokes.
  You can swim breaststroke in the 50, 100, and 200 meter/yard breaststroke, and the Individual medley events.  </div>
