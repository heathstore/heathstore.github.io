<div id= flytext>In the stroke <strong>butterfly</strong>, you use a dolphin kick and a doubled arm stroke.
You also use a 1-2 stroke-kick ratio. Many swimmers believe that butterfly is the hardest of all the strokes.
You can breath whenever you want in butterfly, but most people take 2-3 pulls then one breath, although some Olympians breath every stroke.
 The events in which you swim butterfly are the 50, 100, and 200 meter/yard butterfly and the individual medley events. </div>
