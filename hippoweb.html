   <b><u><h1>All About Hippos</h1></b></u>	  <!--1-->	
	</div>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>				<!--2-->						
   A hippos is also known as a hippopotamus.
   Hippos in the wild can live up to 50 years.
   Hippos love water.
   They spend up to 16 hours in the water.
   There are two species of hippos that live on Earth today, the Common Hippopotamus and the Pygmy Hippopotamus.
   Some people believe that hippos are descendants of pigs but recent studies show that they are related to dolphins and whales.

   <h2>Where Hippos Live</h2>																<!--3-->
   Wild hippos live in the continent known as Africa.
   Common Hippos usually near to rivers and lakes south of the Sahara Desert.
   Pygmy Hippos are usually found in swampy forest of western Africa.
   The Common Hippopotamus usually live in groups called pods.
   On the other hand Pygmy Hippopotamus prefer to live alone.
   <h2>What Hippos Eat</h2>															<!--4-->
   Hippos mostly eat grass and a little bit of aquatic plants.
   This means hippos are herbivores.
   Hippos usually eat at night and graze 1 to 2 miles of grass for 4 to 5 hours.
   Intestines of baby hippos require their mother's feces to digest vegetation.
