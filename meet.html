<div id= meettext>What other sports would call a game, swimmers call a meet.
 In most <strong>swim meets</strong>, swimmers can swim a maximum of 6 or 7 events, with the exception of relays. 
In some bizarre cases, swimmers might swim more or less events, either because that is what the meet offered,
 or because the particular swimmer only wanted, or was able to swim less/more.
 Some swim meets you have to qualify for, and some you can just walk in and swim.
 Here is a list of some meets starting from the highest calibre meets, to the lowest calibre meets.
