<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
My favorite food is pizza. Pizza in my opinion is the best food in the world, 1st after sushi.  It is the best food for playing video games with. 
It is the best combination of meat, cheese, and bread ever made in the history of everything!  If you do not think pizza is the best, something is wrong with you.</p>
<h3>Bread</h3>
<p>
Bread binds  the cheese, meat, and etc.  It is one of the most if not the most important part of the pizza.  Thin crust, stuffed, thick crust, the amount of types of bread are endless! </p>
Thin crust is in my opinion, the best crust because of the crunchiness.  Thick crust is my second favorite type of crust.</p>
<h3>Cheese</h3>
<p>
My favorite type of cheese is feta cheese, then mozerella cheese.  All types of cheese taste good to me.  Pizza without the cheese is no longer pizza. 
You can never have enough cheese.</p>
<h3>Meat</h3>
<p>
My favorite type of meat is anchovies.  Although all types of meat are good, anchovies are the best meat toppings on pizza in the world.  
A <strong>pizza</strong> without meat is a boring pizza.  I will never eat a pizza without meat.</p>
<h3>toppings(vegetables)</h3>
<p>
My favorite vegetable toppings are olives.  Olives are almost always in my pizza.  My second favorite topping is mushrooms.  My third favorite topping is jalepeno peppers.
</p>
<h3>combinations</h3>
<p>
There are tons of combinations with<em> pizza.</em>  All pizza restaurants have tons of preset combinations of toppings, all very tasty.  My favorite preset combination is the meat lover's pizza.</p>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<p>
Without good sauce you can't have a good pizza.  The best sauce for pizza is tomato sauce.  Although some people do like bbq for pizza, I think that tastes bad.
