<strong>Backstroke</strong> is almost freestyle, but on you back. 
You do the same kick and pull just opposite so you propel yourself forward, or in the swimmer's case backwards.
Scientifically, backstroke is the easiest stroke.
The kick is very important to backstroke.
Rotation is also a big part of it.
 Backstroke's events include the 50, 100, and 200 meter/yard backstroke and the individual medley events.</div>
