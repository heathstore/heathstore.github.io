	Have you ever seen a kid bite into a piece of candy and then make a face because
	they realized that it was an almond joy? There is no joy in almond joy! I realize that almonds and chocolate go well
	together but not many kids get that excited to eat a bunch of almonds and coconuts.I'm just saying. <br><br>
