Pandas walk with their paws turned inward. Pandas cannot support their body </br>
on their hind legs which is why they cannot stand on their hind legs. They </br>
also have a fake thumb that corresponds to out fifth finger, and they have a </br>
sixth finger after it. They also have an opposable pseudothumb that</br>
is their first finger.</br></br>
Pandas have thick black and white fur that is very soft and fluffy</br>
Pandas do not have this fur when they are born, they are pink and hairless.</br>
 They are also very vulnerable, because they are the size of a  thumb.
