 <strong>Relays</strong> in all sports are the same. One person starts, and once they finish, the next person starts and so on. 
 There are 4 people in each relay team. 
 Usually there are an A, B, and C relay team for each actual team.
You use a different type of relay start to start in a relay. 
 You swing your arms back and around, then dive for the water in a stream line.
 Computers usually take the fastest times in certain events, and order them in the fastest combination.
 Most of the time, the best relay team will have the second fastest first, slowest second, third fastest third, and fastest fourth.
 The relay events include the 200, 400, and 800 free relay, and the 200, 400, and 
 800 individual medley relay.</div>
